## 🤔 Key Questions for Review

### Strategic Questions
1. Is the 18-month timeline acceptable for full launch?
2. Should we prioritize certain features over others?
3. Are we comfortable with the $1.8M investment?
4. Do we have access to required talent (ML engineers, data scientists)?
5. Should we pursue SEBI registration earlier (Phase 4 vs. Phase 2)?

### Technical Questions
1. Should we start with a modular monolith and migrate to microservices later?
2. Is Kubernetes the right choice or should we use simpler container solutions (ECS)?
3. Should we use managed services (AWS Kinesis instead of Kafka)?
4. Is the multi-region strategy necessary from Day 1?
5. Do we need GPU infrastructure for ML models initially or can we use CPU?

### Risk Questions
1. What if NSE/BSE API access is delayed?
2. What if SEBI registration takes longer than expected?
3. What if user adoption is slower than projected?
4. What if infrastructure costs exceed estimates?
5. What if key personnel leave during critical phases?
